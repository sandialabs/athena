# ATHENA

This folder contains the main code for the ATHENA tool as a pyscaffold project

## Description

If using ATHENA, the DOCKER build system is preferred due to specific dependinces in ATHENA and required sutbools

The `external_repos` folder contains submodules and code required for ATHENA. Timelop and Accelergy are included here as we have modified the code to work with ATHENA. The CACTI tool is a submodule, as we have not modified the code.
